# Impedances
We'll match both circuits with T-structures on both ends, first end needs to be a T-structure in order to
- Avoid a short to ground through the 5 V power supply (should withtstand 5 V)
- Avoid DC signal from coming through on the antenna side.
- In case a signal needs to be sampled from a higher value, make sure the inductor on the right is isolated.

## Input impedance Z11
183-193j

### Matched with T-circuit
- 1.225 pF
- 21.22 nH
- 3.66 pF (5 V capable)


## Output impedance Z22
7+0.532j

### Matched with T-circuit
- 3.66 pF
- 6.825 nH
- 1.5 pF
