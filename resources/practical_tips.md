# Vias
Make sure the ground plane is very well connected.

# Power supply
## Decoupling capacitors
- Add some decoupling capacitors for the power supply


# Measuring
## Impedance 
An impedance is simply a voltage divided by a current.
- Connect a single SMA cable to the relevant connector, check the smith chart and tune the matching network until the impedance is exactly 50 ohms.

- In case of an existing delay in the cable, make sure to account for that by setting a delay.

## Protection
- Check how to protect your device from too much powers
    - perhaps adding an attenuator?

# Coplanar waveguide vs microstrip
Think about whether you'd use 
- a coplanar waveguide (so a copper strip separated by 2 ground planes on each side)
- a microstrip line: a single copper stripline with a ground plane below.
