# Todo


## Verification
- Solder the initial matching guess onto the board.
- Measure the characteristics with the VNA
- Calculate the components required for better return loss using the VNA.

## Testing
- Connect in series with a transceiver and an antenna, check results with an SDR.
- ?Add a bandpass filter?

## Other
- ?Add a Heat-sink? 
	- Is it even necessary assuming we'll get a current of < 100 mA
- Measure the power with an RF power meter, such as the [AD8307](https://www.kaufland.de/product/524761263/?utm_source=shopping&utm_medium=non-paid&utm_campaign=pricecomparison&sid=75584204&gQT=1)
