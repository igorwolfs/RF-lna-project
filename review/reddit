Hi all, I'm an RF-noob looking for some feedback on a couple of small RF projects I'm combining together into a single PCB.
Top left: 2-stage cascode LNA
Top right: single gain stage LNA
bottom: antenna (hopefully) for 868 - 915 MHz
Cascode
Single-gain stage
I tuned both in LTSpice, not taking into account the phase-shift and transmission-line loss, since I'm not sure if these parasitics are dealt with in simulation, or mostly tuned when matching. I'm planning on adding some damping resistors to the single-gain stage (currently 0 ohm) to counter instabilities I encountered in my simulation.
I treated the RF-traces in the LNA as coplanar waveguides, ground plane on L2.
Antenna
I tuned it in openEMS (which is great by the way), impedance and s-parameter plots attached. Appropriate tuning will be done on arrival, I hope to be able to cut off parts of it in case the resonance doesn't reach to 915 MHz.
I plan to later cut the antenna part off from the LNA-part of the PCB.
Below the antenna there's no ground plane, below the stitched ground planes of the antenna (L1-L2) there are no ground planes either.
Main concerns
Everything from (antenna) layout to component choice and LNA design itself. Would be great to get some tips and tricks on how to design a board for easy impedance matching.
Thanks a lot!
